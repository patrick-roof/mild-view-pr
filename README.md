# Blog Machine

## Description

This project allows the user to sign up, login, and create blog posts. The blog contains a title and description, and shows which user made the blog and when. The user can also delete blog posts if they wish. It uses handlebars for the views, as well as node, express, and sequelize.

I learned a lot about routes, user authentication, and the model view controllers while working on this project.
